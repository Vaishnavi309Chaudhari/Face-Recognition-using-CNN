# Face-Recognition-using-CNN

### The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify facial expressions into one of two categories: Angry, Happy. We will use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to train our model, as they have been shown to be effective in image classification tasks. Our approach involves training a CNN model from scratch.
